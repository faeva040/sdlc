# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
**Definition of SDLC:**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step guide that software developers use to create, test, and maintain high-quality software. It's a structured process that includes planning, designing, coding, testing, deploying, and maintaining software to ensure it meets the requirements and functions properly for its users.

**Key Phases of SDLC:**

- **Planning:** Discuss how requirements are gathered, project feasibility is assessed, and plans are made regarding resources, timelines, and budgets.
- **Analysis:** Mention how detailed requirements are analyzed and defined to create a clear roadmap for the software project.
- **Design:** Explain how the software architecture, database design, user interface, and technical specifications are planned based on the defined requirements.
- **Implementation (Development):** Emphasize that this phase involves actual coding or development based on the design specifications.
- **Testing:** Highlight the importance of rigorous testing to ensure the software meets quality standards, is bug-free, and aligns with user requirements.
- **Deployment:** Explain that once the software passes testing, it's ready for deployment in the production environment for end-users.
- **Maintenance:** Conclude by mentioning that post-deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where updates, bug fixes, and ongoing support are provided to ensure its smooth operation.
